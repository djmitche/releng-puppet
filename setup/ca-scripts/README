= Scripts used for puppet certificate generation =

These scripts are used for generating puppet certificates (server and agent) and
sign them by a self signed CA. Using a single CA allows agents to talk to
multiple servers.


== Requirements ==
* make sure that openssl and procmail (for lockfile) packages are installed

== CA Setup ==

* Create a skeleton:

 mkdir /var/lib/puppet/ssl-master
 cd /var/lib/puppet/ssl-master
 mkdir -p ca/{private,certs} certdir client_certs/revoke
 touch ca/inventory.txt
 # Use a hex serial (default is decimal)
 echo "0x1" > ca/serial

* Create OpenSSL configuration file

 cp openssl.conf.example /var/lib/puppet/ssl-master/ca/

* Generate a private key "ca_key.pem" and a self signed CA certificate.  You
  will be prompted to enter a password. Save it to "private/ca.pass" file and
  chmod 400

 openssl req  -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca/ca_key.pem \
   -days 3650 -x509 -out ca/ca_crt.pem \
   -subj 'C=US,ST=California,L=San Francisco,O=Mozilla Corporation,OU=Releng,CN=ca.build.mozilla.org,emailAddress=release@mozilla.com'

* Verify the certificate

 openssl x509 -noout -text -in  ca/ca_crt.pem

== Usage ==
"generate-cert.sh $hostname $output_directory" will generate a certificate for
$hostname and put all needed files into $output_directory.
