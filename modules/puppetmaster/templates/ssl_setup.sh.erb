test -f "${root_ca_cert}" || bail <<EOF
The root CA certificate 'root.crt' is not in ${ca_certs_dir}.

If this is present on another master, then wait for the sync cron job to copy
it here.  Otherwise, you will need to generate this root certificate and a
corresponding key, and keep them in a safe place.

For example:

    openssl req -new -newkey rsa -days 3650 -x509 -subj "/CN=PuppetAgain Root CA" \
        -keyout "/root/root.key" -out "${root_ca_cert}"
    # also copy in the CRL at "${root_ca_crl}"
    chown -R puppetsync:puppetsync ${ca_certs_dir}

Move /root/root.key somewhere safe and private and re-run puppet.
EOF

test -f "${root_ca_crl}" || bail <<EOF
The root CA CRL is not at ${root_ca_crl}.
Please generate it if necessary and copy it from the root CA.
EOF

test -f "${master_ca_cert}" || bail <<EOF
The master CA certificate '${fqdn}.crt' is not in '${ca_certs_dir}'.
You will need to generate this certificate and sign it with the root certificate.

Here's how.

    openssl genrsa -out ${master_ca_key} 2048
    openssl req -new -subj "/CN=CA on ${fqdn}" -key ${master_ca_key} -out master-ca.csr
    openssl req -text -in master-ca.csr
    chown -R puppetsync:puppetsync ${ca_certs_dir}

Check the request's contents in the dump, and then sign it with the root CA.
Then copy/paste the resulting .crt back to
  ${master_ca_cert}
and re-run puppet.
EOF

test -f "${master_ca_key}" || bail <<EOF
The master CA key '${master_ca_key}' does not seem to be in place.
It should have been created while creating the CSR for the master CA.
Please fix
