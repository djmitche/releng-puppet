dotfiles under e.g., modules/users/files/dmitchell

config has a list of usernames that should have access
  use virtual resources?
  need to be able to override per host
  need to be able to enforce absence
  no local management of passwords

interactions with sudo
  via group membership? or is that even worse?

handle ssh stuff (known hosts, too) with custom functions?
